8About bp
We deliver energy products and services 
to our customers around the world, and we plan to increasingly do so in ways that we believe will help drive the transition to a lower carbon future.
We have operations in Europe, North and 
South America, Australasia, Asia and Africa.                
About our 2021 reporting 
Since we launched our sustainability frame we have worked to further embed sustainability across bp. We have also made progress in a number of areas, which are covered in this report.
Our corporate reporting suite for 2021 
comprises several elements, including this report. You may also be interested in:

 Our reporting
Sustainability, resilience and safety
As well as embedding sustainability across our 
strategy, we designed it to be resilient across a wide range of scenarios. As recent events heighten uncertainty and global energy security concerns, we are positioned to help keep the energy flowing that the world desperately needs.
We do this recognizing that nothing is more 
important than safety. While we have seen some improvements in our safety performance over the past year, tragically a bp contractor died in an accident at our Castellon refinery in Spain. We have more work to do to eliminate accidents and injuries so that everyone goes home safe to their loved ones every day. Nothing is
 
more important.
Leaning into greening
The strategic progress we have made so far, and the pace at which society has been moving on sustainability, has given us confidence to accelerate the greening of bp. We now expect that by 2025, more than 40% of our capital expenditure will be in our transition growth businesses, and around 50% by 2030.Or take our aim 4, which is to install methane measurement at all our major oil and gas processing sites by 2023. While we work towards that, our methane intensity has come down by more than 40% since 2019 (from 0.12 to 0.07%). This includes reduced operational methane emissions, and more bp-produced gas available to sell to our customers.
And at our Gelsenkirchen sites in Germany, we 
have reduced our Scope 2 emissions by more than half-a-million tonnes in 2021 (in line with aim 1), helped by our trading team’s long-term arrangement to purchase renewable energy.
Focused on delivery
With our direction set, and the major organizational changes behind us, we are now
 
fully focused on delivering our strategy 
and 
the sustainability aims that underpin it.
Thank you for your support and challenge – it has been vital. We could not have made this progress so far without you – and look forward to your continued backing.
Thank you.We have also increased our net zero aims.  
On aim 1, we are now aiming to cut our 
operational emissions in half by 2030 (up from 30-35%). And on aim 3 (covering the lifecycle emissions for the energy products we sell) we now aim to reduce carbon intensity to net zero by 2050 or sooner – up from 50% – and have increased the volume of emissions covered by this aim, which now includes physically traded sales of energy products. Uniquely among our peers, we are aiming to be net zero across operations, production and sales.
Diversifying and decarbonizing
We have a lot more to learn, but our experience so far is that our purpose – reimagining energy for people and our planet – can help us diversify and decarbonize bp and at the same time create real value and returns for our shareholders. What does that mean in practice?
It means that by doubling down on five transition 
growth engines where we have real strengths – bioenergy, convenience, EV charging, renewables and hydrogen – we can grow as a company and at the same time advance towards our aim of net zero on the products we sell (aim 3).Rooting our new strategy in sustainability
Bernard Looney,  
chief executive officer,  
March 2022Purpose is a company’s north star. In recent weeks, our purpose has guided bp’s response to the military 
aggression in Ukraine. It has helped us to fundamentally rethink our position in Russia – and drives us to support the humanitarian efforts in the region. As I write this letter, our thoughts remain with everyone affected by what is happening.

 Our reporting
Sustainability in action
Against this backdrop, and as we have seen the 
world’s low carbon ambitions gather momentum, we have been in action across the three focus areas – net zero, people and planet. Our aims have helped us plan and prioritize our work. In 2021, that work was about continuing to deliver in the areas that, for bp, are more mature, while defining and embedding our newer aims in
 
areas where we are building our understanding 
of what is needed, and what methodologies and
 
structures will best enable us to deliver.
Performance and progress
This report sets out our performance against those aims where we have clear targets and goals, as well as our progress in the areas that are less well defined.
To share a few examples, this includes:•
 Q
uadrupling our renewables development 
pipeline to over 23GW including 5.2GW in 
offshore wind (contributing to our aim 11).
•
 R
educing operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
by 35% compared to the 2019 baseline (aim 1).• E valuating our net positive impact methodology 
for biodiversity at some of our projects, including the Tangguh Expansion Project and Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Phase 1 in Mauritania and Senegal (aim 16).
•
 S
tarting a pilot in Aberdeen to work with local 
communities as part of our aim to support a just transition (aim 12) and our partnership with Aberdeen to help them deliver their net zero vision (aim 10).
Interconnected aims
Our aims are connected to the three pillars of our strategy – resilient hydrocarbons, convenience and mobility, and low carbon energy – and many are also connected to each other. Perhaps the clearest example is Net Zero Teesside and the related projects that bp is leading in the North-East of England. We are working to develop first-of-a-kind gas-fired power generation with carbon capture, blue and green hydrogen, and further carbon capture capacity for storing emissions from UK industries. As well as developing bp’s interests in each of these business areas, successful delivery of these projects would  Giulia Chierchia,  
EVP, strategy, sustainability  
& ventures (SS&V),  
March 2022Embedding sustainability 
into the way we do business
support low carbon energy investment  
(aims 5 and 11); decarbonization of regions, cities
 
and corporates (aim 10); a just transition 
(aim 12); and support and create thousands of skilled jobs (aim 13).
Putting sustainability at the core  
of bp
Approaching strategy and sustainability in this integrated way is enabling us to prioritize and capture the opportunities in the energy transition – those best aligned to bp’s capabilities and strategic objectives.
We know we cannot achieve this by ourselves, 
and we owe much thanks to our stakeholders who have supported, challenged and worked with us. You have helped us not just to make progress, but to increase our ambition, as Bernard sets out in his introduction. We have made a start, but it is
 
only the start.
As we navigate the changing times ahead, we will work hard to earn your continued support while striving to become a truly purpose-led organization, with sustainability ingrained into the
 
way we do business.The conflict in Ukraine is devastating. As Bernard says in his introduction, our purpose is guiding us as 
we
 
look to help in the ways we can. One is by supporting organizations providing comfort, shelter and aid. 
Another is by maintaining our focus on keeping energy flowing today while transforming bp to sustainably deliver more and more of the reliable, affordable, clean energy the world wants and needs into the future.

2021 at a glance Sustainability at bp
 FoundationsOur values and code of conduct
Our values inform how we do business and 
the decisions we make, including those related to sustainability. They are integral to the way we recruit, develop and performance manage our people.
Safety 
Respect  
Excel lence  
Courage  
One teamBuilding on strong foundations 
Our approach to sustainability is targeted, systematic and collaborative. It rests on strong, 
well-established foundations that guide the way we work. These support our aims, which take us further forward and focus our efforts where we can make the greatest difference.  
We set high ethical standards and try to behave 
in ways that earn and maintain trust, including respecting colleagues and others we work with. We value and prioritize diversity of people and thought. Our values and code of conduct (the code) help us to do this the right way. 
The code is based on our values. It sets 
expectations about how we work and applies to all bp employees. We provide regular training and communications to help employees apply the code in their daily work. 
Employees, including executives, are required 
to confirm annually whether they understand and have followed the principles of the code. Members of the board are asked to confirm that they understand their responsibilities under the code and will apply this knowledge in their role.
We document and clearly inform our suppliers 
that we expect them to operate in a manner consistent with the code.
Read more: bp.com/valuesSafety
Safety is our core value. It is underpinned by our operating management system (OMS), which sets out how we aim to deliver safe, reliable, compliant and sustainable operations. 
Tragically, in July 2021 a contractor died in a pipe 
lifting incident at our Castellon refinery in Spain. We deeply regret this loss and have offered our condolences and support to his family, as well as to his colleagues. We are taking action to learn from this incident by codifying lessons into our OMS and sharing them internally and externally, so we can try to mitigate the potential for this kind of incident to happen again.
Early in 2021, we set a goal to eliminate tier 1 
process safety events, fatalities and life-changing injuries – and set out a plan to help us achieve this. This plan recognizes the value of industry standardization and consistent rules, for example, the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers’ (IOGP) Life Saving Rules. 
Developed by a team of industry experts, the Life 
Saving Rules identify clear actions that workers can take to help eliminate fatalities. The rules will supplement our existing safety practices and further strengthen our OMS. Their adoption is intended to make safety expectations clearer and more consistent for many of our contractors, who operate across the industry. We are rolling out the rules across our operating businesses, identifying ways of embedding them more deeply into working practices.We are also identifying ways to improve process safety by integrating IOGP’s Process Safety Fundamentals. This enhances our OMS and drives further standardization in key areas of industry risk.
Our safety culture
Throughout 2021, we continued work to 
strengthen our safety culture, with the launch of a refreshed set of Safety Leadership Principles. These principles are designed to guide behaviour and ways of working across bp to drive a robust, consistent safety culture in which:
•
 W
e genuinely care about each other 
•
 W
e will not compromise our focus on safety 
•
 W
e encourage and recognize speak-up
•
 W
e understand how work actually happens 
•
 W
e learn why mistakes occur and 
respond supportively
Our refreshed principles are guided by human 
performance, helping us enable a culture of care. It is about understanding how people interact with their working environment, recognizing that they can make mistakes and doing all we can to set them up for success.
Our progress in driving and integrating human 
performance to support our personal and process safety goals was recognized by the Chartered Institute of Ergonomics & Human Factors, which presented bp with its prestigious President’s Award for 2021. This was in recognition of our internal progress and our industry-wide contribution in sharing our human performance learning resources externally.

 Our reporting
 FoundationsDriving safety
Ten severe vehicle accidents (SVA) occurred in 
2021 (2020 five SVAs) while kilometres driven for bp fell by 18% compared with 2020.
We are focusing on improving driving safety. 
In 2021, we carried out a driving safety campaign for some of our employees to raise safety awareness for those returning to driving after commuting less due to the pandemic.
Process safety
The overall downward trend in tier 1 and tier 2 
process safety events (PSE) continued in 2021. Our combined PSE have generally decreased over the last 10 years, apart from in 2019. We had fewer tier 1 and tier 2 PSE in 2021, with one fewer tier 1 PSE and seven fewer tier 2 PSE, compared with 2020.
Work is continuing on a number of process safety 
focus areas including risk management and learning. These are intended to further strengthen our OMS, process safety barriers – which are physical or non-physical means to prevent, control or mitigate accidents – and consequently our safety performance.
Spills and spills prevention
We have made progress in preventing and 
reducing spills over the past 10 years. However, the number of oil spills
e in 2021 was 121, the 
same as in 2020.We managed these concerns as directly as possible and provided ongoing information about burnout and stress management, for example through our globally accessible Employee Assistance Programme. 
At an operational level we needed to defer some 
scheduled activities, however plans are in place to address the impact of this.
Despite the challenging circumstances presented 
by the pandemic, we remained focused on safety; for example, we held our annual contractor and supplier events for operations and project safety virtually, in October 2021.
Personal safety
In 2021, we recorded an increase of 24% in 
our recordable injury frequency (RIF) and an increase in 16% in our days away from work case frequency (DAFWCF) compared with 2020, a year in which both were at an historic low due to the pandemic impacting the nature of work undertaken. 
Compared with 2019, in 2021 our RIF slightly 
improved and, except for 2020, it was better than any time in the past 15 years. For absolute injuries, there was a small increase in recordable injuries (RI) between 2021 and 2020, and a small decrease in days away from work cases (DAFWC) during the same period. In 2021, DAFWC were at their lowest ever recorded level.We review how people interface with the equipment and systems around them. We examine potential causes of stress and fatigue, and the quality of the systems and procedures that people have to follow. Showing care about how work is being done and acting on concerns raised, can help drive a learning culture – one which we hope can consistently and incrementally make the workplace safer. Through our work on diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) and our code of conduct we also aim to support people to speak-up about any safety concerns they have.
Safety during the COVID-19 pandemic
At the time of writing, with the COVID-19 
pandemic ongoing, we are taking steps to support our people. Precautions in our operations and offices, together with enhanced guidance, are focused on safety, hygiene and health, including mental health. Decisions about working practices and returning to office-based working are being made in compliance with local and national regulations, taking into account relevant guidelines. 
During 2021, COVID-19 pandemic-related travel 
restrictions affected our ability to get people to and from our operations. This had human and operational consequences. Those who could travel often faced extended periods away from home, at their workplace or in quarantine, which led to concerns about possible fatigue.

 FoundationsPolitical donations
We prohibit the use of bp funds or resources 
to support any political candidate or party. We recognize the rights of our employees to participate in the political process and these rights are governed by the applicable laws in the countries where we operate. Our stance on
 
political activity is set out in the code. 
In the US we provide administrative support for the bp employee political action committee (PAC) which is a non-partisan committee that encourages voluntary employee participation in the political process. All bp employee PAC contributions are reviewed for compliance with federal and state law and are publicly reported in accordance with US election laws. 
The PAC paused all contributions as of January 
2021 and we expect to restart them in 2022. During this time PAC re-evaluated its criteria for
 
candidate support.
Tax transparency
We take a responsible and transparent approach 
to tax and have open and constructive dialogue with governments and tax authorities. 
Our responsible tax principles align with the bp 
code of conduct, our values and behaviours, and The B Team responsible tax principles, which we endorse. We do not tolerate the facilitation of tax evasion by people who act for or on behalf of bp. 
Read more: bp.com/taxAppropriate training focuses on the needs of employees in locations or roles assessed to be at a high risk of bribery and corruption. Around 12,700 employees completed anti-bribery and corruption training as part of 2021 ethics and compliance risk-based learning.
We assess any exposure to bribery and corruption 
risk when working with suppliers and business partners. When appropriate, we put in place a risk mitigation plan and will choose not to work with a counterparty or to reject tenders if we conclude that the risks are too high. We also conduct anti-bribery compliance audits on selected suppliers when contracts are in place. 
We take corrective action with suppliers 
and business partners who fail to meet our expectations. This action may include terminating contracts. 
We support anti-corruption efforts by  
participating in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Through the disclosure of government revenues and other relevant information, EITI can help to mitigate corruption risks in the extractive sector and support local anti-corruption efforts. In 2021, we
 
participated in multi-stakeholder groups 
in
 
Iraq, Trinidad and Tobago and Mauritania 
and
 
Senegal, to continue our support for 
transparency and local participation in EITI activities.
Revenue transparency and payments 
to
 
government
We support transparency in the flow of revenue from our oil and gas activities to governments. We are a founding member of EITI, which supports the disclosure of payments made to and
 
received by governments in relation to oil, 
gas 
and mining. Underpinning the generally improving trend is
 
several years’ work in OMS areas, including 
ongoing risk management, investigations, process safety and control of work improvements. Risk management processes across the group are monitored and updated to
 
improve their effectiveness. 
The regions and various operating sites collaborate with each other to share relevant examples of good and proven practice, while a central team works to make sure that any serious and complex incidents are thoroughly investigated, and any systemic gaps are closed as soon as possible.

Ethics and compliance
As a purpose-led, values-based company, we are committed to doing business in a safe and ethical manner that is consistent with our code of conduct (the code) throughout our transition. 
Anti-bribery and corruption
Managing bp’s key enduring risks, such as our 
exposure to bribery and corruption, remains essential. We operate in parts of the world where bribery and corruption present a high risk, so it is important we make clear to our employees, contractors, suppliers and others that our commitment to ethical and compliant operations is unwavering. 
The code explicitly prohibits engaging in bribery 
or corruption in any form. Our group-wide anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering and anti-tax evasion policy and procedures include measures and guidance to assess and mitigate risks, understand relevant laws and report concerns. They apply to all bp-operated businesses. Taxes paid to governmentsa

 Our reporting
 FoundationsWe are also continuing to bring high-calibre 
specialized talent into bp from the external market to fill skills gaps and complement our expertise. Of our 64 new group leader appointments since the third quarter of 2020, 15 have been external hires.
Education and employability
We support education and employability 
initiatives and invest in the communities where we work. This helps underpin our future growth by expanding talent pipelines for established skillsets and newer ones, including many of the skills that bp and the world need to get to net zero. These skills are in short supply and competition for talent is high. In 2021, we piloted a new virtual coaching and learning programme, designed to support employee personal development and strengthen our approach to performance management and feedback, with more than 3,300 people.
Leadership capability is critical. We need 
everyone in bp to lead through the energy transition and we are refreshing and relaunching our leadership frame and talent management practices to promote the behaviours and skills needed for the future. In 2021, we offered ‘Leading safe, ethical and inclusive teams’ support to more than 1,100 new line managers and introduced new DE&I training, including our Race for Equity programme, continuing to build leadership capability across bp.
Read more about Race for Equity,

non-conformance with the code or unethical behaviour, compared with around 80 in 2020. This total excludes dismissals of staff employed at our retail service stations.
Our people
Our people are crucial to delivering our purpose and strategy. We focus on attraction, recruitment and development to help ensure we have the skills we need today and are prepared for our transition to become an integrated energy company. 
In 2021, we continued our work to build 
skills forecasts and capability plans in priority disciplines, such as digital and data, hydrogen, offshore wind, and electrification, so that we have the capabilities we need to deliver our strategy. This work is integral to our aim 12 to support a just transition.

Developing our people
bp employees collectively completed more 
than 750,000 hours of formal learning in 2021. This was in addition to on-the-job learning, coaching and mentoring, team growth days and other informal learning opportunities that were available to our employees. Our overall learning catalogue currently includes more than 20,000 course titles, which help individuals to develop leadership skills and technical discipline depth, underpinned by a rigorous core mandatory curriculum centred on safety and compliance. Our curriculum also emphasizes future skills beyond technical and business specialisms – including sustainability, digital, agility and commercial, bolstered by a core set of soft skills.

 FoundationsCyber security risk
The severity, sophistication and scale of cyber 
attacks continue to evolve. The increasing digitalization and reliance on IT systems and cloud platforms makes managing cyber risk an even greater priority for many industries, including our own. The risk comes from a variety of cyber threat actors, including nation states, criminals, terrorists, hacktivists and insiders. As in previous years, we have experienced threats to the security of our digital infrastructure, but none of these had a
 
significant impact on our business in 2021.

Addressing sustainability risks
We are working to further integrate sustainability 
risks into our risk management processes, building on both the labour rights and modern slavery risk assessments that are already in place, and our work on climate-related risks. 
Read more about our approach to  
climate-related risk, on page  48
Environmental and social practices
Our policies and practices set out expectations for how we manage environmental and social performance during our activities. They already include environmental and social requirements covering the majority of our sustainability aims.
As we make progress on our aims and embed 
sustainability into bp’s DNA and culture, we will review our practices and update them as necessary so that they continue to reflect new ways of working across bp.Identifying and managing risk
bp manages, monitors and reports on the principal risks and uncertainties that we have identified as having the potential to impact our ability to deliver our strategy. We identify risks for particular oversight by the board and its various committees in the coming year. In 2021, these included climate-related risks, strategic and commercial risks such as financial liquidity, safety and operational risk including process safety, personal safety and environmental risks, compliance and control risks such as ethical misconduct.
bp’s system of internal control is a holistic set of 
internal controls that includes policies, processes, management systems, organizational structures, culture and behaviours employed to conduct bp’s business and manage associated risks.
The group operations risk committee 
provides oversight of safety and operational risk management for the group, including risks relating to sustainability. Our operating businesses identify and manage risk, using our OMS. We also monitor how risk is managed in non-operated joint ventures.
Read more about how we manage risk in our bp Annual Report 2021 on page  72In 2021, we refreshed our education and employability strategy to support our overall strategy and build on our work over many years to promote science, technology, education and mathematics skills.

Monitoring employee sentiment
We monitor employee sentiment through 
our annual ‘Pulse’ survey, which is sent to all employees, and through our weekly ‘Pulse Live’ survey, which is sent to a representative sample of 8% of employees. 
We did not run an annual ‘Pulse’ survey in 2020, 
so our comparisons are between 2021 and 2019. Despite the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our 2021 survey told us that trust in our senior leadership has increased (up two percentage points compared with 2019) and more employees believe we are making progress on our transformation with a simplified organizational structure (up seven percentage points from 2019). 
We introduced a new overall engagement metric 
in 2021, which scored 64%. Pride, which we have measured and tracked for a number of years, remained strong at 73%, but has declined by two percentage points since 2019. Building on what we have heard, we are now focusing action-planning on four key areas to strengthen engagement – connecting with purpose and strategy, employees’ future excitement at work, career development and inclusion.Our operating management system
Our OMS provides a single framework, designed 
to deliver safe, reliable, compliant and sustainable operations. It includes environmental and social requirements related to our sustainability frame. These requirements apply to businesses where bp has operational control.
All our major operating sites attest or certify to 
ISO 14001, in line with our OMS requirement. We aim to use the planned OMS update in 2022 to better reflect our sustainability frame and aims. 
bp environmental policy
Our environmental policy is established through 
relevant elements of our code of conduct, in particular the sections on ‘operating safely, responsibly and reliably,’ and ‘our code – our responsibility’.
It is supported by relevant aspects of our 
commitment to health, safety, security and environmental (HSSE) performance, our sustainability frame, our biodiversity position and our internal group requirements and guidance, including those comprising OMS.

Biodiversity and protected areas
Our biodiversity position, published in 2020, 
builds on the robust practices we already had in place to manage biodiversity across bp projects. 
We are committed not to operate any new oil 
or gas exploration or production activities inside natural or cultural UNESCO World Heritage sites, or in Strict Nature Reserves and Wilderness Areas as listed on 1 January 2020 and defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). We review this commitment periodically and engage with UNESCO, the IUCN and the UNEP World Monitoring Conservative Centre.Building on strong foundations

 FoundationsAir emissions
We monitor our air emissions and, where 
possible, put measures in place to reduce the potential impact of our operational activities on local communities and the environment.
In 2021, our total air emissions reduced by 38% 
compared with 2020, largely due to reductions in flaring at some of our operating facilities, including US onshore operations.
bp’s operated shipping fleet transitioned to 
very low or ultra-low sulphur fuel oils in 2020 to comply with the International Maritime Organization’s 2020 MARPOL regulation. This also contributed to the reduction in air emissions, with bp’s fleet fully compliant with the regulation in 2021. These reductions were partially offset by operational variances including temporary production-related changes and flaring associated with a new production start-up.

Influencing non-operated joint ventures
We have processes for the management of bp’s

In 2021 this influence focused on net zero operations, the measurement and abatement of methane emissions, biodiversity and human rights. Looking ahead, we plan to embed sustainability more fully in our NOJV processes, and to review all our NOJVs’ portfolios so that we understand more about how we can best work together.We report on the number and overlap of our major operating sites in or near to protected areas and key biodiversity areas in our protected areas update. In 2021, survey activity was carried out in an international protected area as part of the UK Net Zero Teesside project. Prior to this survey, we assessed the associated environmental risks and received executive sign-off.

Human rights policy
Our human rights policy, updated in 2020 in 
consultation with external organizations, aligns with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It is underpinned by the International Bill of Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration of Fundamental Principles at Work, including their Core Conventions. The policy states that we will obtain independent third-party assessments of selected sites and business activities’ conformance with it, on a risk-prioritized basis. In 2021, a third-party assessor began scoping and developing a phased approach to deliver these assessments, starting with our central systems and processes. 
Our code of conduct and OMS also contain

Reducing methane
Our bpx business is on track to achieve its aim of zero routine 
flaring in its US onshore operations by 2025. When bpx began operating its Permian assets in 2019, flaring intensity was over 16%. Today it is less than 1%. Investments in infrastructure, improvements to on-site operations, and enhanced fugitive emissions monitoring have contributed to these methane reductions and we are trialling new technologies to help our businesses achieve more in future.

In 2021, we continued to make progress against 
the five aims to help bp get to net zero we announced in February 2020.
In February 2022, we provided an update on our 
progress against our three strategic focus areas: resilient hydrocarbons, convenience and mobility and low carbon energy.
This progress, combined with our confidence 
in the business opportunities of the energy transition, has enabled us to accelerate two of our net zero aims. In parallel, the pace at which the world is moving to net zero is increasing, something we explore in the ‘New Momentum’ scenario in the 2022 bp Energy Outlook.

Net zero Q&A
What do we mean when 
we
 
talk about net zero?
When we talk about helping the world get to 
net zero we mean achieving a balance between sources of anthropogenic emissions and removal by sinks of greenhouse gases, as set out in article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement
h. When referring to bp 
becoming a net zero company by 2050 or sooner in the context of our net zero ambition and aims this means achieving a balance between: 
•
 T
he relevant Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
associated with our operations (aim 1), Scope
 
3 
emissions associated with the carbon in our 
net share of production of oil and gas (aim 2), or lifecycle emissions associated with our sales of energy products (associated with aim 3); and
•
 T
he total of applicable deductions from 
qualifying activities such as sinks, for example carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and land carbon projects, that are allowed for in our methodology at the applicable time. To deliver our net zero ambition and aims, we recognize that the balance of investment between emissions reduction activities and deductions will be important. We intend to apply the principles of a mitigation hierarchy in our aims, emphasizing the role of actions such as direct operations emissions abatement, reducing our upstream oil and gas production, and shifting our sales portfolio towards lower carbon products.  
Qualifying deductions also have a role to play. 
h ( 1) Article 2.1(a) of the Paris Agreement states the goal of “Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well 
below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.”  
(2) Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement: “In order to achieve the long-term temperature goal set out in Article 2, Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.”

 Performance and progressWhat role will divestments 
play in achieving our net zero
 
aims?
Divestments are, and continue to be, an 
important part of our strategy. They enable us to strengthen our balance sheet and high-grade or diversify our portfolio. They will also help bp to create a resilient, lower cost and lower carbon oil, gas and refining portfolio that is smaller but high quality. 
Divestments contribute to our aims 1, 2 and 3. 
For aim 1, divestments contribute to reducing our operational emissions. For aim 2, we expect our oil and gas production to be around 40% lower by 2030 compared with 2019, from 2.6mboe/d in 2019 to 1.5mboe/d in 2030, with contributions from our current programme of divestments, alongside existing field decline. For aim 3, proceeds from divestments will help to grow our low carbon businesses which over time will contribute to a reduction in the carbon intensity of
 
the products we sell.
Divestments may not lead directly to a reduction in absolute global emissions but by redeploying investable funds to bp they accelerate the pace at which we can grow low carbon businesses. As well as helping us to meet our aim 3, these businesses can help reduce future demand for fossil fuels, and as a result, emissions. We are aiming to increase capital expenditure on our low carbon businesses to $4-6 billion each year by 2030. Our approach to divestment
We are working to reduce carbon emissions 
where possible across our portfolio, including in businesses or assets that we may be considering, or have scheduled, for divestment. Where we are the operator and have mature carbon management plans, we aim to pass those plans on to the buyer. All businesses and assets we sell remain covered by local regulatory requirements. This includes jurisdictions where we are advocating for effective policies and regulations to help the world get to net zero. 
Read more about aims 1, 2 and 3  
on pages 22-24How will we influence  
NOJVs to support our aims?
Non-operated joint ventures (NOJVs) are an important part of bp’s business strategy, including with respect to methane management and net zero. In 2020, bp established a NOJV centre of excellence, which provides support to teams in bp who work with our NOJVs, including support for their efforts to influence in relation to reducing methane emissions and overall sustainability management. 
We see increasing potential for influencing 
NOJVs or partnering with them through memoranda of understanding or strategic collaborations in support of shared goals, on issues such as carbon management, hydrogen and sustainability.Will we rely on offsetting to 
meet our net zero aims? 
We believe that both natural and technological 
emission reductions and removals are critical to reaching the Paris goals. We believe that effective compliance and voluntary markets for high quality carbon credits are important to finance these activities.
We expect that global demand for carbon credits 
is likely to grow as more companies use them to achieve their climate-related goals. So, we intend to continue to offer carbon credits and offsetting solutions to our customers to help them meet their goals.
We do not plan to rely on offsetting to meet our 
2030 net zero aims. We consider that it makes sense to account for carbon credits directly related to our business, for example where carbon credits are bundled with the energy we sell, and looking ahead we plan to do so.
We are currently participating in several initiatives 
and associations to develop and strengthen the quality of the offset market:

Our progress in 2021
We made further progress against our 
operational emissions reduction targets in 2021. Our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, covered by aim 1 were 35.6MtCO
2e, a decrease 
of 35% from our 2019 baseline of 54.4MtCO 2e. 
The total decrease of almost 19MtCO 2e includes 
14.7MtCO 2e in divestments and 2.6MtCO 2e 
in sustainable emission reductions (SERs)b. 
Compared with 2020 (45.5MtCO 2e), Scope 1  
and 2 emissions in 2021 decreased by 22%.
This means that while we have exceeded our 
2025 target, we have more work to do to achieve our overall net zero aim by reducing emissions while bringing new projects online. 
Scope 1 (direct) emissions, covered by aim 1, 
were 33.2MtCO
2e in 2021, a decrease of 20% 
from 41.7MtCO 2e in 2020. Of those Scope 1 
emissions 32.0MtCO 2e were from CO 2 and 1.1MtCO 2e from methanec. Emissions decreased 
due to divestments, delivery of SERs and other permanent operational changes.
Scope 2 (indirect) emissions decreased by 
1.4MtCO
2e, to 2.4MtCO 2e in 2021, a 37% 
reduction compared with 2020. This decrease resulted from lower carbon power agreements, including at our Gelsenkirchen site, and the divestment of our petrochemicals business at the end of 2020. 
In 2021 compared with 2020: •

Our progress in 2021 
Becoming net zero on an absolute basis across 
the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production is in part linked to reducing oil and gas production, which we expect to reduce by around 40% by 2030, against our 2019 baseline. We are taking action to achieve this through portfolio management, including divestments. We are also developing decarbonization strategies for the future, including the potential use of sinks such as carbon capture use and storage, which in future, we intend to allow for in our methodology to support this aim.
The estimated Scope 3 emissions from the 
carbon in our upstream oil and gas production were 304MtCO
2 in 2021, a reduction of 
approximately 7% from 328MtCO 2 in 2020, 
mainly associated with portfolio changes, including divestments and existing field decline. This is in line with our aim to reduce our oil and gas production, and was partially offset by major project start-ups and new well deliveries. Since 2019 estimated Scope 3 emissions have reduced by 16%. We are on track to meet our 2025 target of a 20% reduction against our 2019 baseline.

For terms with  refer to the glossary on page 377 of the bp annual report 2021.Our progress in 2021
In 2021, the average carbon intensity of bp’s 
marketing sales of energy products remained at 79gCO
2e/MJb, as in 2019 and 2020.  We are 
continuing to invest in activities that will decarbonize our business in the future. Reducing the carbon intensity of the products we sell is directly linked to growing the size of our low carbon businesses and providing products with lower lifecycle emissions. Our investments in low carbon as part of our aim 5 have increased from around $750 million in 2020 to nearly $2.2 billion in 2021. 
Much of the low carbon investment we have 
made is expected to feed into carbon intensity reductions later in this decade and beyond. The diversification inherent in our strategy provides us with a range of levers – including our transition growth businesses and the trading activity which is now included within the scope of this aim – as we pursue delivery of our 2025 target and 2030 aim. 
Compared with the 2019 baseline, the carbon 
intensity of bp’s marketing sales of energy products remained flat.
This is because of a lower share in sales of gas 
and power products from 2019 to 2021, caused by a number of factors including a reduction in demand over the period and an increase in refined products demand post COVID-19.Net zero sales
Our aim 3 is to reduce to net zero 
the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2050 or sooner.
This aim applies to the average carbon 
intensity of the energy products we sell .  
It is estimated on a lifecycle (full value chain) basis from the use, production, and distribution of energy products per unit of energy (MJ) delivered.
As updated in February 2022, the scope  
of aim 3 for future reporting years is 
expanding to include physically traded energy products

Our progress in 2021
There are two challenges in tackling methane – 
the identification and quantification of emissions, and finding ways to reduce emissions. This aim addresses both. Our methane emissions intensity is currently calculated using a generally accepted industry methodology and, while it reflects progress in reducing intensity, it will not directly correlate with progress towards delivering our 2025 target, which is based on our new measurement approach.
Throughout 2021, we continued working to 
reduce our operational methane emissions – from upgrades in our current operations to advancing the design and use of new technology. Our aim to deploy methane measurement is focused on improving our understanding and confidence in our methane data in an effort to support our efforts to reduce methane intensity and absolute emissions.
Our methane intensity in 2021 was 0.07%, 
an improvement from 0.12% in 2020
b. 
Methane emissions from upstream operations, used to calculate our intensity, decreased by 40% to around 43.0kt, from 71.6kt in 2020. This continues a declining trend in absolute upstream methane emissions since 2016, when we reported 111kt. Variations in production and divestments accounted for approximately 78% of the absolute reductions reported for 2021, and we also achieved methane reductions (SERs). Marketed gas volumes decreased by 1% from 3,075bcf in 2020 to 3,058bcf in 2021.Methane intensitya,b

Methane measurement
Our plans to install methane measurement at all our existing major oil and gas processing sites continued in 2021, with the ongoing installation of enhanced metering, software for flare efficiency and predictive emissions monitoring on gas turbines in line with our three-year timeframe.
At our US onshore operations we trialled new 
technologies for site level emissions detection and continued using drones and aircraft with methane sensors.
Methane reduction activity
Across our US onshore operations, we are working to achieve zero routine flaring by 2025 or sooner. This includes installing air-assisted flares to improve combustion efficiency and thermocouple sensors on all flare stacks that notify bp operations teams of unlit flares. All bpx flares have auto-ignitors to attempt to remotely reignite extinguished flames.At a number of our North Sea assets, we made improvements such as optimizing the restart sequence of our operations and changing operational parameters to minimize the potential for flares to extinguish under high winds. These changes can help minimize methane emissions.
Technology improvements
Technologies to detect and measure methane 
are evolving at pace. A flexible approach to using different technologies allows us to move towards increased continuous site and source-level measurement systems as more advanced technology becomes available. We use different methods, including drones, aircraft, satellites and fixed video monitoring. We continue to monitor emerging technologies to assess their potential as methane measurement tools.
Autonomous methane measurement
In 2021, bp joined forces with five other 
operators in the North Sea and with the Net Zero Technology Centre to develop a method for offshore methane measurements using autonomous aircraft. The method is designed to meet emerging requirements for atmospheric measurements under the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP). It combines a state-of-the-art methane sensor with a fixed wing autonomous aircraft capable of operating in challenging environments, such as the North Sea. This allows emissions data to be collected while minimizing the requirement for personnel to be present in the offshore environment, reducing overall risk.
a Methane  intensity refers to the amount of methane emissions from bp’s operated upstream oil and gas assets as a percentage of the total gas that goes to market from those operations. 
Our methodology is aligned with the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative’s (OGCI).
b Methane  intensity is currently calculated using our existing methodology and, while it reflects progress in reducing methane emissions, will not directly  correlate  with progress towards 
delivering  the 2025 target under aim 4.

NOJV activities
Our work to collaborate with and influence our 
NOJVs on methane management is coordinated  through our NOJV centre of excellence. We have prioritized collaboration with NOJVs that have the greatest potential to reduce methane emissions. We are working to influence them to set their own methane intensity targets of 0.2% and take action to reduce methane emissions, directly and through industry bodies such as Methane Guiding Principles (MGP) and the new OGMP 2.0. We are keen to share knowledge and learn from our NOJVs.
Collaboration and methane advocacy
bp has been awarded gold status by the United Nations Environmental Programme for our plans to measure and reduce methane emissions in the first year of the OGMP 2.0 reporting framework. The award recognizes the work of many bp teams and collaborations with our partners including NOJVs.
The UN-led OGMP initiative has gathered 
momentum. When we first joined the original OGMP in 2015 there were 10 member companies; there are now more than 70 members, including midstream and downstream companies. 
As a signatory of the MGP, we are currently 
leading a project to develop a free-to-use web-based tool, suitable for use by any oil and gas company, operated or non-operated, large or small, to support improved understanding, reporting and mitigation of methane.We have advocated for progressive methane policy, including the federal regulation of methane emissions in the US and the development of policy and regulations in Europe, for example our response to the EU methane emissions consultation. 
Read more about our advocacy,  
on page  29
Why methane reduction is important in slowing the rate of temperature increase
When methane is emitted into the atmosphere 
unburnt, it has a relatively short atmospheric lifespan of 10 to 12 years. But it is more than 25 times more potent than CO
2 over a 100-
year time span.
Reducing methane emissions could 
dramatically reduce the pace of warming. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), methane was the second largest contributor to warming over the last decade to 2019, with almost 60% of the impact of carbon dioxide.  
During the COP26 climate change conference 
in Glasgow, UK, 103 countries signed the Global Methane Pledge to reduce global methane emissions by 30% by 2030 against a 2020 baseline. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency has proposed the adoption of federal regulations that will require oil and gas operators to detect and repair methane leaks. 
This is a critical step toward helping the US 
reach net zero by 2050 or sooner and we look forward to continuing to engage with the Agency as it develops methane rules.More $ for   new energies

Our progress in 2021
As we continue towards our net zero ambition, 
we target increasing our low carbon investment to $3-4 billion per year in 2025, and aim to increase it to at least $5 billion per year in 2030.
In 2021, low carbon capital expenditure 
increased from around $750 million in 2020 to nearly $2.2 billion. This is due to our continuing acceleration in offshore wind and solar as well as advancing mobility with a bolder ambition in electrification.

Offshore wind
We completed the formation of a 50-50 strategic 
US offshore wind partnership with Equinor to jointly develop up to 4.4GW generating capacity from two major lease areas off the US East Coast through two projects, Empire Wind and Beacon Wind. In the UK, bp and 50-50 partner EnBW were jointly selected as the preferred bidders for two 60-year leases in the UK’s first offshore wind leasing round in a decade – development of these projects, Morgan and Mona, is expected to add up to 3GW offshore wind capacity in the UK. 
In January 2022, together with EnBW, we were 
awarded a lease option to develop a major offshore wind project around 60km offshore from Aberdeen, Scotland. This project, to be known as Morven, will have a potential generating capacity of around 2.9GW, sufficient to power more than three million homes.
SolarLightsource bp is further accelerating growth, 
now targeting up to 25GW by 2025 and will be exclusively developing a potential 9GW solar pipeline for bp following the acquisition of 7X Energy in 2021. Lightsource bp continued to grow its operational portfolio in the US, Europe and Australia in 2021, including new markets in Greece and Poland.
In June 2021, Vendima, five flagship Lightsource 
bp solar projects, began commercial operations in Zaragoza, Spain. The five-project cluster has a total capacity to provide around 250MWp of solar energy, producing electricity which is the equivalent of powering over 107,000 homes. 
These projects also aim to improve local 
biodiversity by planting native species and positively contributing to the local economy through job creation.5

We are achieving significant milestones in 
building our hydrogen and CCS businesses. As part of the East Coast Cluster, the Northern Endurance Partnership has been confirmed as one of the UK’s two initial carbon capture and storage projects. And we have awarded the first engineering contracts for Northern Endurance Partnership and Net Zero Teesside power station. We are also building a hopper of options worldwide, including global export hubs for marine and shipping. 
HyGreen Teesside
HyGreen Teesside could deliver up to 
500MW of low carbon electrolytic-enabled hydrogen production by 2030. We are aiming to start production by 2025, with an initial phase of some 60MWe of installed
 
hydrogen
 
production capacity. A final 
investment decision on the project is expected in 2023. Together with H2Teesside, which has the capacity to deliver a planned 1GW CCS-enabled blue hydrogen, bp projects could deliver 30% of the UK government’s 5GW hydrogen target. The project is expected to fuel the development of Teesside into the UK’s leading hydrogen transport hub, helping enable large-scale decarbonization of heavy transport, airports, ports and rail in the UK, while supporting economic development and regeneration in Teesside. Electrification
We see electric vehicle (EV) charging as a 
transition growth engine for our convenience and mobility strategic focus area. In 2021, we increased capital expenditure in our EV charging business compared with 2020. This aligns with bp’s aim to accelerate our EV charging ambition across key growth markets, through a focus on ‘on-the-go’ charging and fleets and growing our network of around 13,100 charge points today to more than 100,000 by 2030. 
Through strategic collaborations, such as our 
participation in Digital Charging Solutions alongside Mercedes-Benz and BMW, we expect to connect EV drivers across Europe to our network of charge points. We anticipate substantial growth potential in fleet charging and have acquired AMPLY Power, an EV charging and energy management provider for fleets in the US. This acquisition gives us a viable fleet business and has accelerated our entry into one of the fastest growing fleet charging markets in the world.

in hydrogen and during 2021 we progressed current projects in Australia, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. We also identified several new projects and continued to explore new opportunities across multiple geographies. In the UK, we have made several recent announcements, including our plan to build a hydrogen production facility at Teesside in the North East of England, intended to deliver up to 1GW of blue hydrogen by 2030, and the HyGreen Teesside project targeting 60MWe of green hydrogen production by 2025. In addition, we have established partnerships with the cities of Aberdeen and Houston to integrate city energy systems around hydrogen, solar and mobility solutions. Initial capital expenditure is expected to be deployed from 2022 onwards. 
Hydrogen production is also set to play a part in 
the strategic partnership we have formed with ADNOC and Masdar to provide clean energy solutions for the UK and UAE as well as in our collaboration with Valencia regional government to explore decarbonization opportunities in the region.

Advocating
Our aim 6 is to more actively advocate 
for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing.
We have stopped corporate reputation 
advertising campaigns, and this is enabling us to redirect resources to promote well designed climate policies. In future, any corporate advertising will be to advocate for progressive climate policy; communicate our net zero ambition; invite ideas; or build collaborations.
We will continue to run recruitment campaigns 
and advertise our products, services and partnerships – although we aim for these to increasingly be low carbon.
Our progress in 2021
Advocacy takes place at regional, country, state and local levels but in 2021, we focused on themes including methane emissions reductions, electrification and the need to support reskilling for the energy transition. Our activities included:
•
 S
upporting carbon pricing in the US, including 
actively advocating for the cap and invest 
programme within the Washington State Climate Commitment Act. This has now passed into law, and we are working with state agencies as they develop rules for implementation. 
•
 P
roviding technical input to the US Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) ahead of its proposal for new rules aimed at reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry.  We advocate for direct federal regulation of methane in the US and we look forward to engaging with the EPA as it further develops its methane rules. 
•
 C
ontributing to a series of actions from both 
industry and government to help accelerate the mass adoption of electric vehicles across the UK, as part of our membership of the Electric Vehicle Fleet Accelerator.

climate and sustainability reporting in the US and UK by responding to requests for information by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) in the UK.
•
 C
ontributing to the UK Green Jobs Taskforce 
report calling for government, industry and the educational sector to take action to deliver on the promise of a green industrial revolution and net zero.

•
 S
upporting the drafting of EU methane 
regulations by developing technical methane recommendation papers issued through industry bodies such as the Methane Guiding Principles, as well as more targeted bp-specific feedback. This effort will continue in 2022.
In addition, our CEO publicly welcomed the ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package – to help the EU to cut its emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. We have responded to multiple consultations on these proposals, for example, on the ramp-up of production of sustainable aviation fuel and increasing the overall share of renewables to at least 40%.

Incentivizing employees
Our aim 7 is to incentivize our global 
workforce to deliver on our aims and mobilize them to become advocates for net zero.
This will include continuing to allocate 
a percentage of remuneration linked to emissions reductions for leadership and around 22,000
a employees.
Our progress in 2021
To help our employees deliver our strategy and sustainability aims, we are educating them about the importance of net zero, incentivizing them to become advocates and providing the support they need to do so. In 2021, we have made progress in all three areas: incentivization, education and advocacy support.
Incentivization
Our annual bonus for all eligible employees, 
including the bp leadership team, has been linked to a sustainability measure since 2019. The bonus scorecard against which our employees are measured incentivizes them through three themes: safety and sustainability (30%), operational performance (20%) and financial performance (50%).
For sustainability this includes a measure 
related to sustainable emissions reductions. In 2022, our annual bonus scorecard will remain unchanged for employees. We will expand sustainability measures in the long-term incentive plan scorecard for group leaders, through two social measures on employee engagement and improved ethnic minority representation within our senior level leader population, along with the inclusion of an aim 1 net zero operations measure. 
Read more in our bp Annual Report 2021 on page  122
In addition from 2022, over 40% of the performance-based share awards for our senior leaders will be related to low carbon actions and delivering our strategy.
We offer sustainable benefits to eligible UK 
employees, including the choice of electric fleet vehicles. In 2021, through our carbon offsetting scheme offered as part of our employee engagement, bp employees offset a combined 75ktCO
2e for domestic carbon and travel, including 
c
orporate aviation. The offsetting scheme is 
set to be rolled out globally in 2022. These two employee schemes are unconnected to bp’s operational emissions, which are not being offset.
Education and advocacy
In 2021, we launched our new digital training 
course ‘Net Zero + Me’, which we developed to show how employees across bp contribute to our ambition. We also appointed our first low carbon skills and learning team to help our people build the capability they need  as we pursue our net zero ambition and scale our low carbon businesses. We have created a community of employee advocates, supported by a growing communications and engagement network. Throughout 2021, these advocates supported a number of progressive climate policy campaigns, including the rEV index campaign, which measures the UK’s progress in transitioning to electric vehicles. By the end of 2021 more than 2,900 advocates were active across bp. 
Aligning
 associations
Our aim 8 is to set new expectations 
for our relationships with trade associations around the globe.
We will make the case for our views on 
climate change within the associations we belong to and we will be transparent where we differ. And where we can’t reach alignment, we are prepared to leave.
Our progress in 2021
We belong to trade associations that offer opportunities to share good practice and collaborate on issues of importance to us, not just policy and advocacy. bp’s voice is one among many, but we work hard to make our case and enlist the support of like-minded companies for progressive climate policies. Progress is sometimes challenging and uneven because associations need to take account of members’ differing views. We recognize this and will continue using our influence to make our case.
We periodically assess the alignment of key 
associations with our position on climate. In 2021 we published an update on the progress made by five that we had found to be only partially aligned in our 2020 inaugural report:
•
 F
ollowing advocacy by members, including 
bp, the American Petroleum Institute (API) 
declared support for direct federal regulation of methane in its Climate Action Framework, in which it also states that it will support carbon pricing mechanisms. We are encouraged by the Framework’s focus on transparency and reporting. 
•
 b
p was among the companies that urged 
the US Chamber of Commerce to take a more active and positive approach to climate policy, which it did in its January 2021 policy update. This included support for a ‘market-based approach to accelerate GHG emissions reductions’ and the direct regulation of methane emissions.
•
 T
he National Association of Manufacturers’ 
position has evolved in the area of carbon pricing as the organization has stated support for ‘market based options’.
•
 W
e were also encouraged by progress 
made concerning support for progressive climate policy by the Australian Institute of Petroleum and the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

Transparency
 leader
Our aim 9 is to be recognized as an 
industry leader for the transparency of
 
our reporting.
On 12 February 2020, we declared our support 
for the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 
We intend to work constructively with the 
TCFD and others – such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) – to develop good practices and standards for transparency. 
Our progress in 2021
Throughout the year we have taken steps to increase the transparency of our reporting on climate-related matters and sustainability more broadly. For example, we:
•
 P
ublished our SASB index, reporting against 
metrics from the Oil & Gas – Exploration & 
Production standard.
•
 R
esumed submission to the CDP (Climate 
Disclosure Project) climate questionnaire and received an A- score.

 Expanded TCFD disclosures
For 2021, we have reported in line with the 
FCA listing rule for premium listed companies LR 9.8.6(8)
a and made climate-related financial 
disclosures against each TCFD Recommended Disclosure that we consider to be consistent both with the Recommended Disclosure and the related Recommendations. You can read these full disclosures covering governance, strategy, risk and metrics and targets in the bp annual report 2021 on pages 55-66. 
Read more: bp.com/TCFD
Developing scenarios
Our chief economist contributed to work 
requested by the TCFD from the WBCSD (World Business Council for Sustainable Development) ‘Climate Scenario Analysis Reference Approach for Companies in the Energy System’, to develop business-relevant approaches to climate scenario analysis that support and inform disclosures about strategic resilience. 
We hope that as companies use standard 
variables from the Catalogue, it will allow for greater consistency and comparisons of disclosures. We have drawn on the Catalogue to conduct our scenario analysis as part of our TCFD reporting.
The use of these scenarios in this way 
complements how we use scenarios in the bp Energy Outlook, which inform our understanding of the energy transition and the global energy system. This helps us to think about different outcomes and how they might impact our strategy.

Clean cities  
 and corporates
Our aim 10 is to launch a new team 
to create integrated clean energy and mobility solutions.
We launched our regions, cities and solutions 
team in 2020, to help countries, cities and corporations around the world decarbonize.
Our progress in 2021
In 2021, we continued working towards our target of partnering with 10-15 cities globally by 2030.
We already have partnerships with Houston in the 
US and Aberdeen in Scotland. In Aberdeen we signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Aberdeen Harbour to explore the possibility of identifying and potentially developing projects to reduce emissions and lower air and noise pollution from vessels arriving there. In January 2022, in the Valencia region of Spain, we signed MoUs with the state government and ceramic industry associations, to explore ways to decarbonize public and private mobility, port and airport operations and industry in the region. This builds on our plans to transform our Castellon refinery to be capable of producing green hydrogen, biofuels and renewable energy. 
Our regions, cities and solutions team is working 
to meet corporates’ complex decarbonization needs through access to a ‘one stop shop’ of low carbon energy solutions from across bp businesses. 
We made progress against our intention to 
partner with corporates in the heavy industry, heavy transport and hi-tech and consumer products sectors. 
Heavy industry
We signed an MoU with CEMEX, a global 
leader in the building materials industry, to support its 2050 ambition to deliver net zero concrete. We intend to work with CEMEX to potentially develop decarbonization solutions for the production and transportation of their cement products. Heavy transport
We have agreed to work with corporates from 
the shipping, aviation and trucking industries. Together with the Maersk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, we signed a partnership agreement committing to a long-term collaboration on the development of new alternative fuels and low carbon solutions for the shipping industry. 
We also signed an MoU with the shipping and 
logistics company NYK Line to collaborate on future fuel and transportation solutions to help shipping and other sectors decarbonize. In relation to shipping, the collaboration will focus on ways of transitioning from current marine fuels to future fuels and associated value chains such as CO
2 shipping.
We announced plans to create a decarbonized air corridor between the UAE and UK through a strategic partnership with Masdar and ADNOC. We also progressed our strategic partnership with Qantas to supply sustainable aviation fuel to the airline from 2022 for selected flights from London to Australia departing from London’s Heathrow Airport.
Hi-tech and consumer products
We signed an agreement with Infosys to develop 
and pilot an ‘energy as a service’ solution and digital platform, with a pilot to be carried out at its Pune campus in India. We also signed an MoU with Schneider Electric to collaborate on jointly offering integrated energy solutions to customers.Partnership updates
During 2021, we progressed a number of 
partnerships originally announced in 2020.
In Aberdeen, we have formed a joint venture 
with Aberdeen City Council to build and operate Scotland’s first green hydrogen hub, supplying hydrogen for the city’s mobility and heating needs. The addition of the ScotWind offshore wind lease brings the potential for greater scale, enabling the hydrogen hub to supply neighbouring regions. 
As a result of the successful ScotWind bid, 
together with our partner EnBW we will work to establish an operational centre in Scotland, and make Aberdeen our global operations and maintenance centre of excellence for offshore wind, creating up to 120 new direct jobs. It is expected to contribute up to £40 million per year to the economy.
In July, we progressed our partnership with 
Microsoft to create renewable energy deal structures for its data centres. Microsoft and bp are also working together to find innovative low carbon solutions – exploring concepts such as the development of clean energy parks powered by next-generation technologies. We are also using Microsoft’s Azure cloud services to access its machine learning and data analytics tools.

More clean    energy
Our aim 11 is to develop enough  
clean energy to benefit more than  
36 million people.
By 2030 we aim to have developed 50GW 
of renewable generating capacitya – broadly 
enough to meet the power needs of 36 million people
b, including exploring ways to make clean 
energy accessible to those who need it mostc.
     
Our progress in 2021
We have set two objectives for this aim: 50GW renewable energy equivalent developed to final investment decision (FID) by 2030; and programmes to support access and affordability. We have made progress against both in 2021.
Read more: Aims and objectives summary
Developing more renewable energy
We set a target of 20GW of renewable energy generating capacity to be developed to FID by 2025 with an aim of 50GW by 2030. We are on track with 4.4GW brought to FID by end of 2021 and 23GW in the pipeline. Our development pipeline includes new solar development projects agreed by Lightsource bp in the US across 12 states and in New South Wales, Australia, as well as offshore wind projects in the US and UK. 
In the UK in January 2022, we were successful 
in the ScotWind licensing round with our partner EnBW, adding 1.5GW net to our pipeline. This brought our offshore wind pipeline to over 5GW net of offshore wind projects in the core UK
 
and US markets.
bp and EnBW have agreed to develop an 860km2 
lease located 60km off the coast from Aberdeen as a fixed-bottom offshore wind project with a total generating capacity of around 2.9GW, sufficient to power more than three million homes. We intend to make Aberdeen our offshore wind centre of excellence for operations and maintenance, supporting Scotland’s energy transition.
Read more about our investments in  
low carbon, on page  26
Access and affordability programmes
Throughout 2021, we reviewed ways in which we can support access to affordable energy and in 2022, we are set to develop and outline an approach to meeting this objective. We already have initiatives underway to widen access to affordable and sustainable energy.Just transition
Our aim 12 is to support a just energy 
transition that advances human rights and education.
We support the Paris Agreement, which 
recognizes the importance of a just transition – one that delivers decent work, quality jobs and supports the livelihoods of local communities.
To support a just energy transition, we aim to 
collaborate with key stakeholders and other industries to support the advancement of human rights through the transition. We will do this by developing just transition plans in priority areas and helping the workforce to develop skills for the future energy system, taking a socially inclusive approach. We aim to build stronger relationships with local communities, based on mutual trust and respect, and will support civic dialogue, greater transparency and capacity building, where we work.
Our progress in 2021
We have set five objectives for this aim:

the systems, processes and metrics that we will need in order to progress towards our 2025 targets and 2030 aims.
Read more: Aims and objectives summary
Enabling a just transition
In 2021, we advanced initiatives that support a just transition for the bp workforce and for people living in communities where we operate.
Together with the Council for Inclusive Capitalism 
and Boston Consulting Group and in consultation with the Vatican Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, we co-led an initiative called the Just Transition Workstream, which involved CEOs from energy-intensive companies, investing firms, academic institutions and civil organizations to assist businesses in playing a role
 
in helping workers, communities and 
customers share the benefits of the energy transition. This resulted in the Just Energy Transition Framework for company action and a
 
learning hub to share emerging good practices. 
This work is helping to inform bp’s activities in support of a just transition.
Throughout 2021, we supported the development 
of the Energy for a Just Transition collaboration led by Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) and The B Team and are now active participants. The collaboration brings together energy and utilities companies and other stakeholders to develop practical guidance on how companies can integrate just transition principles into their sustainability strategies and practices.

And in 2021 we became a member of the Global 
Business Initiative for Human Rights (GBI), a cross-sector organization shaping practice and building capability to implement respect for human rights. GBI has begun developing a workstream on how companies can support a just transition.
In the UK, we co-funded research with Business 
in the Community (BITC) and other partners to gain shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with a just transition. BITC’s Climate Action Leadership Team is chaired by our SVP Europe and head of country UK, while our SVP talent also participates in BITC’s Employment and Skills Leadership team.
Just transition for the workforce
We aim to provide our people with the skills 
they need for their current roles and for the energy transition. We use skills forecasting and capability plans to help us make decisions about recruitment and development to help ensure we have access to the skills we require. 
Read more about developing our people,  
on page  14
We support education and employability activities that help people develop transferable skills needed for careers in energy and other sectors, often with a focus on disadvantaged and under-represented communities. We do this through many partnerships and social investments. In 2021, these included: 
•
 F
unding scholarships internationally for 
more than 100 students, of which 60% 
were women, through the bp Global STEM academy, delivered by our partner AFS Intercultural Programs. •
 H
elping Omani graduates to build technical 
skills around desalinization through the TAHLYA programme, including internships and a pathway to onward employment opportunities.
•
 H

We are committed to advancing social mobility and in 2021 our EVP for people & culture, joined the Levelling Up Goals initiative in the UK as a commissioner. Many of our education initiatives support social mobility, as do our apprenticeship programmes. In 2022, we intend to share our approach to advancing social mobility across bp, building on our Social Mobility Pledge.
Just transition for local communities
In 2021, we worked to develop collaborations to 
support the just transition in local communities where we work. In the UK we are scoping an initiative that supports research and engagement with local communities in Aberdeen to understand their views on a just transition.  
It will inform future initiatives and action plans. 
We also engaged extensively with the local 
community in Teesside to help us develop our plans for H2Teesside and Net Zero Teesside Power projects. Based on this engagement, we propose to help local people build skills and capabilities, to foster community regeneration and to advance social mobility. We committed to continue co-creating these initiatives with the local community if our bids are
 
successful 
in 2022.Supporting civic dialogue               
and transparency
We are a member of several organizations that 
support this objective and have continued to participate in them, aiming to publish targets/aims in 2023. They include the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights Initiative and IPIECA. We will continue to work with third parties, including NGOs, to explore what can be done to support civic dialogue and build capacity for transparency, good governance and the rule of law wherever we work, as the energy transition evolves.
Decent work
We are progressing our efforts to improve working conditions at our sites and in our supply chains. In 2021, we focused on establishing a more systematic approach to labour rights and modern slavery (LRMS) risk management across our operated businesses by supporting them to implement the LRMS requirements as outlined in our operating management system (OMS). This has enabled a better understanding of our risk profile across our operated businesses. 
Read more: bp.com/modernslavery
During 2021, we continued to improve our systematic approach to pre-contract due diligence by making greater use of evidence-based desktop reviews and other actions to address and remedy issues. This approach helps us identify whether or not potential suppliers will be able to meet our LRMS expectations, if additional controls are needed, and how to introduce them if this is
 
the case. Respect and remedy
In 2021, we confirmed accountabilities for social matters across bp, so that we can respond more systematically to current and emerging risks and opportunities for communities. We also worked to assess how different operated activities across bp conform with our internal worker and
 
community standards. 
We are working to improve engagement between
 
local teams and to update how we 
measure, mitigate or improve the effectiveness of
 
our outcomes and outcomes for communities.
With our partner, Shift, centre of expertise on
 
the
 
UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights, we are developing a methodology to support our objective to assess the quality of community relationships. We aim to progress this
 
in 2022 by running pilots at two bp sites.

Indigenous peoples 
A number of bp operated businesses are 
located
 
in countries where indigenous peoples 
(IPs) live, including Indonesia, Australia and the US. Our human rights policy makes it clear that whenever practicable, we apply the principles of free, prior and informed consent when consulting and engaging with IPs on new projects, recognizing their human rights and respecting their sensitivities around livelihoods, land, environment and culture. Our internal standards for projects and operations reflect the policy.

Community trust and engagement
We work to build good relationships with local 
communities, enhancing their resilience and seeking to avoid actions that might exacerbate social inequity or tensions, by operating to our applicable standards. Understanding and engaging with local communities, including vulnerable groups, is key to this.
We provide operational-level mechanisms for 
local communities and our workforce to share concerns or provide feedback relating to bp or our
 
contractors. These include the bp speak up 
line OpenTalk and our network of community liaison officers (CLOs). If we confirm that we have caused or contributed to adverse impacts on the human rights of others, we provide or co-operate in remediation, while not preventing access to alternative remedies if justified.
Community feedback in 2021
In 2021, there was an 8% decrease in the 
total number of community complaints. Opportunities to engage directly with communities and receive their feedback, including any complaints were limited in some regions due to COVID-19 restrictions. Most of the
 
community feedback received 
was
 
attributable to European refineries.
We have enhanced our internal standards and ability to receive and respond to community feedback across regions and refineries.12
Responsible security
In 2021, we continued to reinforce the importance of security and human rights. We made it a requirement to include contractor performance reviews on security and human rights in our security risk management process, contributing to our responsible security objectives. We plan to
 
implement this requirement in 2022. 
We also updated our contract clauses on the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights to include conformance with our human rights policy, and we plan to make them mandatory in all new contracts agreed with  
in-scope security services. This will provide a key performance indicator. Within the framework of the Voluntary Principles Initiative, we are also developing a conflict analysis tool for inclusion into our security risk management process.
Human rights policy
Our human rights policy aligns with the UN Guiding Principles of Business and Human Rights. The policy states that we will obtain independent third-party assessments of selected sites’ and business activities’ conformance with it, on a risk prioritized basis.

Our aim 13 is helping more than 
one million people build sustainable livelihoods and resilience.
We will support the communities where 
we work to build greater resilience and more sustainable livelihoods. We will focus our social investment in support of our sustainability aims. Through these actions we aim to reach more than one million people. We will also support our workforce through quality jobs with fair conditions.
Our progress in 2021
We have set three objectives for this aim: 
•
 S
upport livelihoods
•
 F
air wage and remuneration
•
 S
trategic social investment in support 
of sustainability
Throughout 2021, we worked to build the 
foundations needed to deliver these aims.
Read more: Aims and objectives  summarySupport livelihoods
We are in the process of defining a more systematic approach to how we help people and communities develop sustainable livelihoods and become more resilient. We already collaborate in this respect with local communities in several locations around the world, including the USA, Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritania and Senegal, Indonesia and Angola. 
In the Benguela and Huambo provinces 
of Angola, bp and the National Agency for Petroleum, Gas and Biofuels funded demining and agribusiness programmes. By the end of 2021, 23 out of 40 known minefields were cleared by around 130 specially trained local people. The agribusiness project has helped around 4,000 farmers and 10,000 locals acquire job skills and create local co-operatives to sell products from their farms or small entrepreneurial businesses. Women make up more than half of those trained to run businesses.
The shared achievements at our Tangguh LNG 
facility over the past 10 years also demonstrate this approach in action. In 2021, the operation updated its Sustainability Development Programme to help strengthen the resilience of
 
local communities, with a timeline from 2021 
to 2025. The programme includes prioritizing indigenous people in social programmes and supporting broader partnerships and networking in Bintuni Bay. It sets targets for improving community health, supporting the government in providing access to education, and promoting local entrepreneurship. 13

Over the past three years we have worked hard 
to increase community and local government involvement at Tangguh. Due to government investment being diverted to help address the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus in 2021 changed to response activities designed to support community livelihoods during a time of restrictions. We are set to resume our wider support for community and local government empowerment from 2022 onwards.
Fair wage and remuneration
bp was the first major energy, mobility and convenience employer to be accredited as a
 
Living Wage Employer by the Living Wage 
Foundation in the UK. We aspire to provide all our employees worldwide with fair wages and in 2021 we partnered with the Fair Wage Network to increase our understanding of the different definitions of fair wages and to benchmark against its extensive fair and living wage database. 
During 2022, we will continue working with 
the
 
Fair Wage Network to develop our fair wage 
objective. We are currently undertaking country-level assessments and aim to publish our 2025 and 2030 targets later in 2022.Strategic social investment
We will continue to focus our social investment activities on improving people’s lives and building community resilience at a local level where possible. We are working to standardize how we evaluate which social investment opportunities would have the greatest impact for communities and we are working to support delivery of our aims through 70% of our social investment by 2025.
bp Foundation
The bp Foundation supports two 
main  
programmes: matching employee 
contributions and supporting disaster relief efforts. Eligible employees can request matching funds to grow the impact of their personal contributions and volunteer time donated to eligible charities of their choice. 
The bp Foundation provides support for 
disaster and humanitarian relief efforts to areas severely impacted by natural disasters, and where bp has a local employee and business presence.
In response to the humanitarian crisis in 
Ukraine and neighbouring countries, the bp Foundation plans to double match funding for any amount employees donate to our nominated charities.Greater equity
Our aim 14 is greater diversity, equity 
and inclusion for our workforce and customers, and to increase supplier diversity spend to $1 billion.
We want our workforce and customers to 
experience greater equity – fair treatment according to everyone’s different needs and situations – while also helping our partners in
 
the bp ‘ecosystem’ do the same. We’ll aim 
to do this by improving workforce diversity and workplace inclusion, making customer experiences more inclusive and increasing our annual expenditure with diverse suppliers, including female, and under-represented or minority groups (supplier diversity) to $1 billion by 2025.
Our progress in 2021
We have set three objectives for this aim: 
•
 D
iverse workforce, inclusive workplace culture 
and employee experience
•
 I
nclusive customer experience
•
 M
ultiply diversity, equity and inclusion 
(DE&I) impact through ecosystem partners 
and suppliers 
Read more: Aims and objectives  summaryThroughout 2021, we made progress towards
 
meeting these objectives, establishing 
governance and measurement processes to enable ongoing performance improvements. 
In June 2021, we published our first DE&I report, 
which we plan to update annually.
Read our DE&I report: bp.com/DEI
Workforce DE&I
In 2021, we made progress in setting the foundations for meeting our objectives. These include confirming accountabilities, defining the governance process and acquiring the data insights that we need going forward.
We put in place a global framework for action 
to advance and integrate DE&I in our regions and businesses. It comprises three pillars: transparency of internal and external data; accountability collectively across bp; attracting talent through processes and programmes that create equal opportunity.
As part of this framework for action, we rolled out 
a global DE&I scorecard across our 11 bp entities – giving our leaders better insights, which they can use to increase diversity and foster inclusive, equitable employee experiences. We added a new metric that covers minority representation in the workforce to help link our performance to progress. The launch of self ID means that employees can now voluntarily share their gender identity, pronoun preference and military status with us. This information will help us identify and support our diverse populations more effectively.13 14

All 11 entities are working to finalize their own 
data-informed, global action plans, which will follow our framework for action template.
In 2021, we launched our Leadership Inclusion 
for Talent (LIFT) programme, to support the progression of Black and African American colleagues into senior leadership roles. LIFT includes self-discovery workshops, assessment tools to target opportunities to advance, one-to-one coaching and reciprocal mentoring with senior leaders. 
In the US and UK, we developed and rolled out 
Race for Equity, a mandatory racial equity and inclusion programme for bp leaders, and we intend to extend it to all employees over the next two years. Race for Equity aims to achieve greater inclusion by building empathy, sharing perspectives and employee stories, and exploring the impact of biases and stereotypes. It supports our people to speak up, advocate and take action. Inclusive customer experiences
We have mobilized around 170 people from across bp to champion more accessible and inclusive customer experiences. We aim to evolve a more systematic, measurable approach to this objective using the many initiatives currently underway to guide us. These include:
•
 O
utreach work with our business resource 
groups (BRGs) to make use of their knowledge 
and insights, for example a mystery shopping exercise in bp retail sites to test LGBT+ inclusion through the bp Pride network.
•
 Wo
rking with Fuel Service, an external partner, 
so that UK customers with physical disabilities can call or message ahead on journeys to arrange assistance at bp retail sites.
•
 B
uilding a communications library with 
examples of good practice for inclusive communications and revising our briefing templates to support communication campaigns that take DE&I into account more explicitly.
•
 E
xploring ways to benchmark our performance 
so that we can use reliable measurements to guide us and make our reporting more credible – for example our retail customer market research surveys now include a question on
 
inclusivity of customer experience.Multiplying DE&I impact 
with
 
partners and suppliers
Our UK, US and global DE&I frameworks for 
action reinforce our commitment to supplier diversity and to establishing inclusive supply chain
 
objectives in our procurement processes. 
Our US supplier diversity programme
Our target is to double our spend with certified 
diverse suppliers in the US by 2023 and to reach $1 billion annual spend by 2025. Through our US
 
supplier diversity programme, we have spent 
$1.3 billion with certified diverse suppliers since 2018. In 2021, we spent around $200 million with
 
more than 100 minority, woman, and 
veteran-owned companies.
What we mean by a ‘diverse supplier’
In the US we define a diverse supplier 
as
 
a
 
for-profit business that is at least 51% 
owned, operated, managed and controlled by people with one of the following designations: women business enterprise, minority business enterprise, LGBT+, veteran-owned business, disabled or service disabled. These designations can differ across regions.
 Expanding supplier diversity worldwide
In 2021, we grew our preferred diverse suppliers 
from around 280 to around 370, and our Supplier Diversity Advocacy Council promotes relevant initiatives, including the use of supplier diversity metrics in operating plans. Our diverse supplier registration platform has been refreshed and is integrated with our procurement systems.
We are assessing diverse spend outside 
the
 
US and in 2021, we contacted suppliers to 
promote certification and request their current status. We also introduced a global definition of
 
supplier diversity and set out plans for regional 
leaders to become supplier diversity advocates. Following engagement with the Billion Dollar Roundtable, which promotes best practice in this field, we are developing supplier diversity strategies for the UK, Canada, China, Brazil, South
 Africa and Australia.14

Read more: Aims and objectives  summaryWorkforce health and wellbeing
In October 2021, we launched ‘Thrive’ – our new wellbeing portal – to support our workforce and their friends and families, in building and maintaining healthy habits across all aspects of wellbeing. 
We also started implementing our global health 
hubs strategy, which aims to improve access to health resources in general for employees and their families. The first hub is being implemented in the UK and the second, which will serve Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey and the Caspian region, is set to be in place by the second half
 
of 2022. 
The COVID-19 pandemic
We are continuing to monitor the pandemic, 
and provide guidance to bp sites. The pandemic response activities reinforce the need to be prepared for infectious disease outbreaks and provide insights that we can incorporate in an updated Emerging Infectious Disease Outbreak Plan. 
Through our intranet we provide ongoing 
guidance about relevant health topics, including issues specific to the pandemic, such as vaccination, other protective measures, and up-to-date travel advice. We encourage our workforce to get vaccinated, take advantage of
 
any national testing resources and maintain 
other pandemic mitigation barriers. 
We have an online pandemic frequently 
asked questions resource in place to support our people whatever their working location. We also share information updates through our COVID-19 response teams and health and
 
communication networks.Mental health and wellbeing
As the pandemic continues, and following our reinvent process to introduce a new structure, leadership team and new ways of working, it has become more important than ever that our people can talk openly about mental health and get help if they need it. We have codified what we have learned both internally and externally over the past two years into our company pandemic plans.
In 2021, we maintained our focus on mental 
health and wellbeing. We enhanced our in-house training programmes, with 14,000 employees attending some form of mental health training across more than 250 sessions – an increase in attendance of 8% compared with 2020. This training covered a range of topics, including resilience, burnout, managing change and leadership mental health skills. We continued our partnership with Headspace and increased the number of family and friends eligible to enrol. By the end of 2021 more than 10,900 employees and family members had signed up to the app.
In October 2021, we ran a comprehensive 
activity programme to support World Mental Health Day, including awareness, discussion and learning sessions and, for the third year running, a video in which employees shared their own mental health struggles. More than 5,000 people watched the video and more than 5,500 visited the event website.bp is a founding partner of The Global Business Collaboration for Better Workplace Mental Health and in December 2021, members of our mental health network contributed to the collaboration’s video and guide on empowering employees to share their mental health experiences. We have extended the provision of training for our leaders on mental health, although this work is in its early stages. 
Community health and wellbeing
We have made progress on identifying ways of supporting our community health and wellbeing objectives, including research, benchmarking and engagement with stakeholders. We will continue developing our priorities for action and will set specific objectives for our work on community health and wellbeing.
Our partnership with the mental health charity 
Mind continued in 2021. We are working together to support workplace mental health. 15

Our biodiversity position, published in 2020, 
builds on the robust practices we already had in place to manage biodiversity across bp projects.
Read our biodiversity position:  
bp.com/biodiversity
The 2021 UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) Part 1 emphasized the need for action to put biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030. The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) was launched to develop a framework against which businesses can disclose their nature-related risks and impacts, and the Science-Based Targets for Nature (SBTN) initiative is developing nature-related targets and metrics for consideration by businesses. We joined both the TNFD Forum and the SBTN corporate engagement programme.
We also supported the need for action on 
biodiversity in a number of other ways, including:
•
 P
articipation in the UN Convention on Biological 
Diversity (UN CBD) Business and Biodiversity 
Forum to discuss how businesses can support biodiversity as part of the build-up to COP15.• P romoting the need for action on biodiversity as 
a member of Business for Nature and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.
•
 C
onsultation with the UK Department for 
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs about the importance of making biodiversity a mainstream consideration for businesses, and the draft UN CBD post-2020 global biodiversity framework.
•
 P
laying a leading role in partnership with the 
International Chamber of Commerce UK and IEMA, in establishing the UK Business & Biodiversity Forum, which supports businesses to integrate biodiversity into their activities and decision-making.
Net positive impact in bp projects
Our focus in 2021 was on developing our methodology for NPI on biodiversity in new projects. We worked with Fauna & Flora International (FFI) to do this. To inform how the
 
methodology might work in practice we 
evaluated it on three major projects and eight smaller ones – including the Tangguh LNG expansion in Indonesia, Net Zero Teesside in the UK, and Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Phase 1 in
 
Mauritania and Senegal. We are also 
working with Equinor to help develop the practical application and implementation of an NPI approach at our joint offshore wind developments
 
off the US East Coast.
We have shared our approach with partners and
 
industry associations, consulted with 
a team
 
of external technical experts, and 
presented
 
it at the IUCN World Conservation 
Congress. We have issued an NPI interim guide
 
to assist our
 
projects organization.Biodiversity enhancement 
We are currently defining how we can best
 
support biodiversity restoration and 
the sustainable use of natural resources, by identifying relevant projects that we can take forward with partners. Some of our operations are already taking action.
Working with water management association 
Emschergenossenschaft, we are reviving the dormant Lanferbach stream bed outside the Gelsenkirchen refinery site to re-route the local Lanferbach channel to the Emscher River. By deepening the old stream bed and constructing a new pump station that will detour the stream away from the refinery, we aim to remove the risk of water pollution and restore local biodiversity. An environmental assessment conducted by an independent expert highlighted the benefits of this approach.
In 2022, we intend to shift our focus to 
working
 
with existing bp operations to enhance 
biodiversity. We also aim to support biodiversity restoration in countries where we have current or
 
growing investments. Enhancing   biodiversity
Our aim 16 is making a positive 
impact
 
through our actions to restore, 
maintain and enhance biodiversity where we work.
We will do this by putting our biodiversity 
position into action. In doing so, we expect that from 2022 all new bp projects in scope will have plans in place aiming to achieve net positive impact (NPI), with a target to deliver 90% of actions within five years of project approval. We also aim to enhance biodiversity at our major operating sites and support biodiversity restoration and sustainable use of natural resource projects in the countries where we have current or growing investments. We will also continue to work with others, including our joint ventures, to influence and promote collective action on biodiversity.16

We are building on requirements introduced in 
2019, for operations located in water scarce areas to develop water management plans to mitigate availability risks. In 2022, we will start reviewing our internal standards and practices in the context of our sustainability frame. 
We review our water impacts, risks and 
opportunities, taking into account the availability, quantity and quality of water and any regulatory requirements. This is done every year at major operating sites and periodically at others. 
Our water consumption in 2021
In 2021, we saw a 2.2% fall in freshwater 
withdrawals and a 4.1% fall in freshwater consumption, compared with our 2020 baseline
a. 
This was largely due to an improvement in the calculation of freshwater consumption across our retail sites and some operational efficiency measures. For example, at our Castellon refinery, water consumption was reduced by approximately 176,000 m
3, by feeding osmosis 
water to the cooling towers. There was an increase in freshwater use at our bpx energy operations during 2021.
We actively manage our freshwater demands 
in
 
areas of stress and scarcity. Based on analysis 
using the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Global Water Risk Atlas, four of our 17 major operating sites were located in regions with medium to extremely high water stress in 2021. Based on anticipated changes in the areas WRI marks as water stressed, this number may increase to 12 by 2040, assuming a business-as-usual scenario with no portfolio changes.At major operating sites, 0.1% of our total freshwater withdrawals and 0.6% of freshwater consumption were from regions with high or extremely high water stress in 2021 (compared with 4% and 8% respectively in 2020). This is mainly due to the divestment of Geel Chemicals and the WRI’s downgrading of the location of the Kwinana refinery to being a location with low
 
baseline water stress, both of which took 
place in 2021.
Our wastewater treatment performance 
was
 
flat
 
in 2021. The average chemical oxygen 
demand concentration of the treated water discharged from bp operated treatment facilities to the freshwater environment remained at 38mg/l in 2021.
Read more: bp.com/ESGdata
Improving water efficiency
A key focus for 2021 was evolving our water management by developing a methodology and approach to improve water efficiency. We are working to align our actions with international water stewardship good practices and to follow a water management framework.
Building on our work to date, we are launching 
detailed site-based assessments at selected sites to help us identify further operational efficiencies. Our onshore business in Oman, which completed a detailed Water Value Improvement process in 2017/18, is already undertaking water assessments and others are due to start soon, including our Castellon refinery in Spain.Water replenishment collaboration
Our second objective for this aim is collaborating to target opportunities for replenishing freshwater in stressed and scarce catchments where we operate. We intend to measure the impact of any collaborations through the application of volumetric water benefits (VWBs) as defined by WRI
b. 
In 2021, we defined different kinds of replenishment activities, worked to identify operating sites in stressed and scarce water catchments at which interventions are needed, and consulted potential partners. We are looking to launch our first programme in 2022.
In some instances, we are already taking action 
to help replenish water in local communities. For example, in Mauritania and Senegal, where fresh water is a scarce resource, access to clean water was identified as a priority during the project consultation with the communities in N’diago, where thousands of people often experience long-term water shortages. 
Following feedback from the communities 
and
 
through collaboration with our business and 
implementing partners, we launched a project in April 2020 to bring clean water to the area, which  continued into 2021. 
The project has involved extending and renovating 
the N’diago water supply network, including construction of a 200 m³ water tower and a distribution network. Water pumped from the Senegal River, using solar energy, is filtered and then supplied to more than 3,000 people in the N’diago area.
In Turkey, we worked with Atatürk University 
between 2016 and 2021 on the provision of drinking and irrigation water supply as part of our
 
social investment programme. Water positive
Our aim 17 is becoming  
water positive by 2035.
We aim to replenish more freshwater than we consume in our operations. We will do this by being more efficient in operational freshwater use and effluent management, and by collaborating with others to replenish freshwater in stressed and scarce catchment areas where we operate.
Our progress in 2021
We have set two objectives for this aim: improved efficiency of operational freshwater use and effluent management; and collaboration on the most impactful opportunities to replenish water in stressed and scarce catchments where we operate.

Championing
nature-basedsolutions
Our aim 18 is championing nature-
based solutions and enabling certified natural climate solutions.
We aim to use nature-based solutions (NbS) to 
deliver value and contribute to our people and planet aims in our operations and through our business activities. We will also support the development of scalable markets for certified natural climate solutions that help the world reduce deforestation, get to net zero and deliver environmental and social benefits.
Our progress in 2021
We have set two objectives for this aim: to use NbS to deliver value and contribute to our people and planet aims; and to enable emissions reductions through investments in certified Natural Climate Solutions (NCS). 
Read more: Aims and objectives summaryWe are working towards delivery of a NbS action plan by the end of 2022 and some of our projects are already beginning to implement NbS related actions as the plan is being developed.
What are nature-based solutions and natural climate solutions? 
Nature-based solutions (NbS) are actions 
to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human wellbeing and biodiversity benefits. 
Natural climate solutions (NCS) are a sub-
set of nature-based solutions that focus on actions to reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions through nature conservation, restoration and improved land management.
Natural climate solutions
We aim to support efforts to scale up high quality NCS, which can deliver both environmental and social benefits. We recognize that focused collaboration is required by market participants to enable NCS to achieve their potential to contribute to the Paris goals. 
We only originate and trade NCS credits certified 
to third-party standards, such as Verra and the American Carbon Registry. We conduct due diligence on NCS projects and programmes that we originate, and we plan to test potential updates during 2022 following review of our due diligence process in 2021. We expect our processes to evolve over time to reflect external developments in the voluntary carbon market.In 2021, we worked to strengthen our low carbon trading team’s capability while also continuing to grow our NCS portfolio. Our NCS programme in Mexico with the US Agency for International Development and partner Pronatura México A.C has delivered its first credits from 15 initial Improved Forest Management projects. Further projects are expected to deliver credits in 2022.
Finite Carbon, in which we hold a majority 
stake, co-authored a new methodology to provide uniform carbon offset standards designed specifically for small landowners. The methodology has been approved by the American Carbon Registry, and Finite Carbon plans to use it to offer small forest landowners across the US access to the voluntary carbon market through its CORE Carbon™ online platform. In November 2021, Finite Carbon launched a forest carbon offset programme in Canada that offers forestland owners and First Nations an opportunity to manage their lands to remove and store carbon dioxide, using
 a methodology approved by the 
American  Carbon Registry.
We have continued our external engagement to support the scaling up of high quality NCS in carbon markets. We contributed to and supported the Taskforce for Scaling Voluntary Carbon Market’s (TSVCM) phase 1 and 2 reports and plan to participate in the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets’ (IC-VCM) consultation group. We also contributed to the NCS Alliance Guiding principles for investing in Natural Climate Solutions and continue to participate in
 
the Alliance. We also participate in the following additional NCS related trade associations:

Unlock  circularity
Our aim 19 is to unlock new  
sources of value through circularity.
We want to keep materials in use for longer 
and value them throughout their lifecycle. We will do this by using resources responsibly and embracing circular principles in design, operations and decommissioning and aim to work with partners and our joint ventures to create opportunities.
Our progress in 2021 
Our objective for this aim is to increase the circularity of our existing operations and products and identify circular opportunities in new projects and businesses. 
Read more: Aims and objectives summary  
Increasing circularity across bp
During 2021, we continued building the foundations needed to embrace circularity in bp, by evaluating the suitability of various third-party definitions and frameworks to be adopted within our internal methodology.Castrol  is already in action on circularity through 
its PATH360 strategy, which has set out aims for 2030 to save waste, reduce carbon and improve lives. The strategy embraces circular economy thinking – looking at the lifecycle of products to see how they can be improved, extended, reused or recycled. By 2030, Castrol  aims to 
reduce its plastic footprint by half, halve the net carbon intensity per litre of its products, and help its commercial customers towards their sustainability goals by saving energy, waste and water.
Castrol is also supporting newer, growing sectors 
such as renewable energy and e-mobility.
Waste streams 
During 2021, we piloted more granular metrics 
in our operations for waste stream reporting. These are designed to create a common global language for bp waste categories. They are more closely aligned with reports required by regional authorities and waste market practices, helping to highlight opportunities for improvement and pointing out where we can deliver the greatest impact through circularity. bp operations plan to report using these metrics for their 2022 data.
We are focusing on reducing generated waste 
across our activities, from construction to operating and decommissioning. The waste that we generate is being treated in ways that reflect priorities set out in the EU waste framework directive Waste Hierarchy and the basic principles of the circular economy; in several instances, providing useful resources for other industries. Some waste streams are non-hazardous and others potentially harmful, so
 
we 
use various technologies to treat and manage them effectively.
Read more about waste, on page  16Read more about decent work, on page  36
Read more about our aim 14 greater equity, on page  39
We have created a roadmap of high priority areas
 
for goods and services with a focus 
on improving greenhouse gas emissions performance and continuing to act on opportunities as we identify them. 
We have trialled the inclusion of sustainability 
factors in our major purchasing decisions and focused on supplier sustainability strategies, greenhouse gas emissions, use of renewable energy and circular approaches to product design and content. We applied these factors to differentiate supplier responses and create a shortlist of potential suppliers. This approach was used in our EV charging programme and the decommissioning and recycling of Don and Miller subsea infrastructure in the North Sea.
In 2021, we set up a sustainable supply chain 
ambassador network aiming to raise awareness and mobilize our purchasing teams to help embed sustainability into our supply chain strategies and activities.
Collaborating with suppliers 
We aim to reduce the impact of our activities with
 
our partners, by collaborating on 
the research and design of our products. For example, in collaboration with Baker Hughes we have developed a new bespoke corrosion inhibitor for our operations in Trinidad and Tobago. This product has a reduced potential for impact on
 
water quality and lower product 
toxicity, it produces zero bioaccumulate and provides effective corrosion prevention. It has also lowered cost by 18% in
 
comparison with the 
previous product. Sustainable
purchasing
Our aim 20 is developing a more 
sustainable supply chain.
We will work with our key suppliers to embed 
sustainable practices, focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the circularity of what we buy.
Our objective for this aim is to define our sustainable procurement policy and set long-term aims by 2023. 
Read more: Aims and objectives summary 
Our supply chain in 2021
We currently operate in more than 65 countries and have over 40,000 suppliers. These include contractors, vendors, service providers and contingent labour. Our annual third-party spend in 2021 was approximately $51 billion (2020 $49 billion).
Our progress in 2021
We continued to progress our efforts on human rights, labour rights and modern slavery in relation to our ‘decent work’ objective under aim 12, and on supplier diversity in relation to our ‘multiply DE&I impact through suppliers’ objective under aim 14. 19 20

 Embedding sustainability Sustainability at bpSustainability in our culture
In 2021, we ran awareness sessions to explain 
our purpose, strategy and sustainability frame to employees to help increase understanding of how these elements deliver value for bp, our stakeholders, society and the planet. And we updated the training we provide on our values and code of conduct, to emphasize the importance of sustainability.
Read more about our culture and values,  
on page  11
We ran a series of stakeholder engagement sessions across our operating businesses, culminating in a carbon management framework workshop involving more than 120 leaders from across bp. The workshop aimed to help integrate carbon into business processes and management systems across our operations, and included a focus on net zero carbon culture.
Through our new Global Sustainability 
Network, launched by employees, we have already
 
engaged close to 2,000 of our people 
across
 
40 countries. And in 2021, more than 
1,500 sustainability awards were made through our energize recognition platform, celebrating progress in our three focus areas: net zero, people and planet.
We have linked our annual cash bonus for eligible 
employees to sustainable emissions reductions since 2019. In 2021, these measures were aligned with our updated strategy and net zero Embedding sustainability

ambition, and tied to a balanced scorecard that 
comprises safety and sustainability, operations, and financial measures. In 2022, we will follow this scorecard approach for the annual bonus, using the same measures. 
We are evolving our performance management 
model to allow for continuous planning and real-time feedback. All bp employees set priorities for their contribution to safety and creating value. In 2021, we provided guidance to help them set objectives that incorporate sustainability elements.

business
Embedding sustainability will take time and 
we are adopting a targeted, systematic and collaborative approach to implementing our sustainability frame across bp. We are also reviewing and when necessary, updating relevant aspects of our systems and practices, including our operating management system (OMS), so that they reflect our aims.
We are working with all our business entities to 
make sure we prioritize our actions and focus our efforts accordingly. All bp entities are currently reviewing where they need to focus effort and developing plans to support the delivery of our sustainability frame. This will include developing teams’ capabilities when necessary. Climate-related risk
As part of our annual process the bp leadership 
team and board review the group’s principal risks and uncertainties. Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy has been identified as a principal risk, covering various aspects of how risks associated with the energy transition could manifest. Physical climate-related risks such as extreme weather are covered in our principal risks related to safety and operations.
Climate-related transition risks 
and
 
opportunities
At a group level, we have identified three broad, material climate-related transition risks and opportunities:
•
 T
he value of our hydrocarbon business could 
be impacted by climate change and the 
energy transition.
•
 O
ur ability to grow or deliver expected returns 
from our transition growth businesses could be impacted by the energy transition.
•
 O
ur ability to implement our strategy could 
be impacted by evolving attitudes towards the energy sector and climate change and the energy transition.Climate-related physical risks
The physical risks identified across bp 
primarily relate to severe weather. In relation to our offshore facilities, climate-change could potentially increase the uncertainty around severe weather events, such as extreme waves, which in turn could affect the future risk profile of assets over their lifetime. We also recognize that we could face other forms of physical climate-related risk over the longer term, including those associated with sea level rise, extreme temperatures and flooding, which could impact our operations.

Before we launched our new people and planet aims in March 2021, we undertook an extensive engagement process with different stakeholder groups to test the aims as they were being developed. We continued this engagement after sharing our sustainability frame.
We collated the post-launch feedback for review 
and discussion with our sustainability forum (SVP level), group sustainability committee (EVP level) and board safety and sustainability committee. We have used the feedback gathered as well as the guidance the forum and committees provided to help us with the next stage of our work as we implement and embed our aims.
Getting to net zero
Carbon Mitigation Initiative  – Based at 
Princeton University, the Carbon Mitigation 
Initiative (CMI) is an independent academic research programme sponsored by bp and administered by the High Meadows Environmental Institute. CMI is Princeton’s largest and most long-term industry-university relationship. Established in 2000, CMI’s mission is to lead the way to a compelling and sustainable solution to the carbon and climate change problem.In 2021, CMI published its final Net-Zero America report, which outlines five distinct technological pathways for the US to decarbonize its energy system. The study’s five scenarios describe in detail at state and local level, the scale and pace of technology, infrastructure and capital mobilization needed across the country. It also highlights the implications for land use, incumbent energy industries, employment, policies and health. In 2021, Princeton kicked off a new project to investigate how land-based climate solutions can be deployed to maximize carbon storage on land while simultaneously maintaining global biodiversity, clean energy and food security.
Climate Action 100+ – We are in regular 
dialogue with Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) via our investor co-leads. We appreciate the engagement, constructive challenge and support, including those issues raised at our AGM in 2021. The outcome of the first CA100+ Net Zero Corporate Benchmark exercise was released in March 2021. bp was one of only three companies that achieved ratings of at least ‘partial’ across the nine assessed indicators. We continue to report in accordance with the 2019 resolution requisitioned by CA100+ on climate change disclosure.
Environmental Defense Fund  – Our work with 
the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) focuses 
on developing technologies and management practices to accelerate methane emission reductions across the global oil and gas industry.Institutional Investors Group for Climate Change  – We contributed to the development 
of the Institutional Investors Group for Climate Change (IIGCC) net zero standard for the oil and gas sector. We are currently participating in a pilot that is expected in time to inform the CA100+ Net Zero Corporate Benchmark. We expect this to provide a helpful framework for promoting comparability in disclosures by companies in the oil and gas sector.
Mission Possible Partnership – The Mission 
Possible Partnership (MPP) is focused on driving decarbonization across the value chain of the world’s highest-emitting industries, supported by an expanding network of nearly 300 partners. As part of the partnership, we are participating in initiatives that could drive the decarbonization of four carbon-intensive sectors in industry and transport over the next decade: aviation, marine, steel and concrete and cement. The MPP is also taking action in the aluminium, chemicals and trucking industries. MPP comprises four core partners: the Energy Transitions Commission, RMI, We Mean Business coalition and the World Economic Forum.
Oil and Gas Climate Initiative –  The CEO-

 Our reporting Sustainability at bpOur materiality process
In 2021, we worked with an external agency 
to refresh and update specific elements of our materiality assessment process for our sustainability reporting so that it reflects external developments relating to sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting, as well as the first year of our new strategy and sustainability frame. The refresh and update process involved in-depth research to identify new and emerging ESG topics. 
The research included reviewing ESG 
frameworks, ESG legislation and industry trends. Existing material issues were also considered to confirm their continued strategic significance. We discussed and validated the findings of this research with internal stakeholders, including environmental and social subject matter experts. We updated the board-level safety and sustainability committee on the outcome of the process. 
We identified 21 key issues that are important 
to bp and mapped them to the key areas of our sustainability frame. Our updated research in 2021, highlighted the increasing significance of two issues: water management and health and wellbeing. These two issues were previously considered sub-topics of other material issues but have been added as individual material issues in 2021 to reflect their increasing significance. Both of these are aims in our sustainability frame.

Key assurance procedures
To form our conclusions, we undertook the following procedures:
•
 E
xamined the documents relating to bp’s sustainability 
performance, including safety and operational 
risk documentation, internal audit outputs, and board committee minutes, to understand the level of management awareness and oversight of sustainability performance;
•
 I
nterviewed staff responsible for managing data 
processes and data management systems at group level;
•
 E
xamined a sample of control documentation for non-
financial management information;
•
 E
xamined disaggregated data reported by a sample 
of businesses to assess whether the data have been collected, consolidated and reported in accordance with the Reporting Requirements and Definitions; and
•
 P
erformed procedures over the completeness of the data 
and whether the subject matter data has been collected, consolidated and reported accurately at group level.
We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion.Our conclusion
Based on our procedures described in this report, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the selected subject matter stated above presented in the Reports, for the financial year ended 31 December 2021, has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with bp’s Reporting Requirements and Definitions.
The basis of our work and level of 
assurance
We carried out limited assurance on selected bp’s safety 
and environmental KPIs (KPIs 1-21) in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised). Under ISAE 3000 an assurance engagement may be performed as a reasonable assurance or limited assurance engagement. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement; and consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is designed to enhance the intended users’ confidence about the subject matter information but is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. To achieve limited assurance ISAE 3000 requires that we review the processes, systems and competencies used to compile the areas on which we provide assurance.
Inherent limitations
Inherent limitations exist in all assurance engagements due to the selective enquiry of the information being examined. Therefore fraud, error or non-compliance may occur and not be detected. Additionally, non-financial information, such as that included in the Reports, is subject to more inherent limitations than financial information, given the nature and methods used for determining, calculating, and sampling or estimating such information. 
Our work has been undertaken so that we might state to 
bp those matters we are required to in this report and for no other purpose. Our work did not include physical inspections of any of bp’s operating assets. While we acknowledge that this report will be published on the bp website, the maintenance and integrity of that website is the responsibility of bp. The work that we carried out does not involve consideration of the maintenance and integrity of that website and, accordingly, we accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to this report and the Reports, since they were initially presented on the website. 
Our independence and competence
We complied with Deloitte’s independence policies, which address and, in certain cases, exceed the requirements of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants in their role as independent auditors, and in particular preclude us from taking financial, commercial, governance and ownership positions which might affect, or be perceived to affect, our independence and impartiality, and from any involvement in the preparation of the report. 
We have confirmed to bp that we have maintained our 
independence and objectivity throughout the year and that there were no events or prohibited services provided which could impair our independence and objectivity. 
 
W
e have applied the International Standard on Quality 
Control 1 and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
Roles and responsibilities
bp is responsible for the preparation of the sustainability information and statements contained within the Reports. It is responsible for selecting appropriate KPIs with which to describe the entity’s performance, and establishing and maintaining appropriate performance management and internal control systems from which the reported information is derived. 
Our responsibility is to independently express conclusions 
on the subject matter as defined within the scope of work above to bp in accordance with our letter of engagement. Our work has been undertaken so that we may notify bp of those matters we are required to inform them of in this statement and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than bp for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.

forecasts, projections and forward looking statements – that is, statements related to future, not past events and circumstances with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of bp and certain of the plans and objectives of bp with respect to these items. These statements may generally, but not always, be identified by the use of words such as ‘will’, ‘expects’, ‘is expected to’, ‘aims’, ‘should’, ‘may’, ‘objective’, ‘is likely to’, ‘intends’, ‘believes’, ‘anticipates’, ‘plans’, ‘we see’ or similar expressions. In particular, such statements, among other statements, may include but are not limited to:
statements relating to the purpose, ambition, 
aims, targets, plans and objectives of bp – as well as statements regarding expectations for bp’s strategy including for bp to transform from being an international oil company focused on producing resources, to an integrated energy company focused on delivering energy solutions for customers; plans and expectations regarding bp’s ambition to be a net zero company by 2050 or sooner and help the world get to net zero, including its five aims to get bp to net zero across its production, operations and sales, as well as its aims in respect of, methane measurement at major oil and gas processing sites by 2023 and subsequent reduction of methane intensity of operations, and aims to increase the proportion of investment into non-oil and gas businesses over time; plans and expectations regarding bp’s five aims to help get the world to net zero, including the aim to more actively advocate for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing, the aim to incentivize bp’s global workforce to deliver on these aims and mobilize them to become advocates for net zero, the aim to set new expectations for relationships with trade associations around the globe, the aim to be recognized as an industry leader for the transparency of its reporting and the aim to launch a new team to create integrated clean energy and mobility solutions; plans and expectations for bp’s Sustainability Frame that underpins the strategy including ten aims (our people and planet aims) regarding more clean energy and the plan to have developed 50GW renewable energy generating capacity to FID by 2030, supporting a just transition that advances human rights and education and includes developing just transition plans in priority areas, helping over 1m people build sustainable livelihoods, greater diversity, equity & inclusion for our workforce and customers and increasing supplier diversity spend to $1 billion, enhancing the health and wellbeing of our employees, contractors and local communities, putting our biodiversity position into action including the expectation that from 2022 all new bp projects in scope will have plans in place aiming to achieve net positive impact, replenishing more freshwater than we consume in our operation, using nature-based solutions (NbS) to deliver value and contribute to our people and planet aims in our operations and through our business activities and using circular resources and embracing circular principles in design, operations and decommissioning, working with our key suppliers to embed sustainable practices, focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the circularity of what we buy and planning to create a circularity methodology and set circularity aims by the end of 2023; expectations that by 2030 bp’s net production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids will be around 40% lower relative to 2019; plans and expectations about growing our renewables and 
bioenergy businesses and seeking early positions in hydrogen and carbon capture, use and storage and strengthen our gas position; our role in the Net Zero Teesside (NZT) and Northern Endurance (NEP) projects;
plans and expectations in relation to divestments 
including non-core assets; expectations regarding bp’s partnership with Equinor for offshore wind in the US; plans to continue to focus on the customer and scale up our differentiated offers in growth markets and for next-gen mobility solutions, including electrification, sustainable fuels and hydrogen; plans to do more to integrate sustainability into our governance structures and business processes, so that it informs our strategic and operational decisions; statements regarding the uncertainties in the energy transition; 
Forward looking statements involve risk and 
uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will or may occur in the future and are outside the control of bp. Actual results or outcomes may differ from those expressed in such statements, depending on a variety of factors including those set out in the ‘Risk factors’ in our Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 and any other matters referred to at  
bp.com/sustainability . 
In addition to factors set forth elsewhere in this report, those set out above are important factors, although not exhaustive, that may cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements.
The term ’material’ is used within this document 
to describe issues for voluntary sustainability reporting that we consider to be of high or medium importance in terms of stakeholder interest and potential business impact. Material for the purposes of this document should not, therefore, be read as equating to any use of the word in other bp p.l.c. reporting or filings.bp’s Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 may be downloaded from bp.com/annualreport . 
No material in the Sustainability Report forms any part of that document. No part of this Sustainability Report or bp.com/sustainability constitutes, or shall be taken to constitute, an invitation or inducement to invest in bp p.l.c. or any other entity and must not be relied upon in any way in connection with any investment decisions. bp p.l.c. is the parent company of the bp group of companies. Where we refer to the company, we mean bp p.l.c.. The company and each of its subsidiaries are separate legal entities. Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the term “bp” and terms such as “we”, “us” and “our” are used in the Sustainability Report for convenience to refer to one or more of the members of the bp group instead of identifying a particular entity or entities.Cautionary statement
